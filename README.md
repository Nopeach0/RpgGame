RPG game Ashes of Atheron only the CUI, included with README.md
# Ashes of Aetheron (Java RPG)

A text-driven RPG game built in **Java 21**, featuring console-based gameplay and a **JavaFX GUI mode**.  
The game combines **lore-driven exploration**, NPC interactions, and a **combat system** with Weapons, Armor, and Consumables, all defined dynamically in external resource files.

## 🚀 Features
- **Two Modes**: 
  - Console loop (`RpgGame.main`)
  - GUI (JavaFX / FXGL wrapper via `MainFX`)
- **Player System**: Name input, health management, inventory with equippable items.
- **NPCs**:
  - Friendly NPCs loaded from `npc_locations_quests.txt`
  - Enemies with health, roles, and lore from `enemy_lore_data.txt`
- **Combat**:
  - Player attacks with Weapons
  - Enemies counterattack with variable damage
  - Armor reduces/reflects damage
  - Consumables restore health or give effects
- **Resource-Driven**: All lore, NPCs, items, and enemies are stored in text files → easy to expand.
